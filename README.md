For Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) who have returned to India, understanding the tax implications and legal requirements regarding the declaration of foreign assets is crucial. The Indian government has specific rules governing the income tax return for NRIs and the reporting of overseas income and assets to ensure tax compliance. This article delves into the legal framework surrounding the declaration of foreign assets by returning NRIs and how they can stay compliant.

Legal Framework for Foreign Asset Declaration

NRIs returning to India need to be aware of tax laws and reporting obligations under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015, mandates the disclosure of all foreign assets held by Indian residents. The failure to declare these assets can result in severe penalties and legal consequences.

Residential Status and Tax Liability

The tax liability of an NRI in India depends on their residential status as per the Income Tax Act. The categories include:

Resident: Taxed on global income, including foreign assets.

Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident (RNOR): Taxed only on Indian income and income received in India.

Non-Resident (NR): Taxed only on Indian-sourced income.

If an NRI tax return India filer has returned and qualifies as a Resident, they must report their foreign income and assets in the income tax return filing for non-resident Indian category under Schedule FA (Foreign Assets) of the ITR forms.

Mandatory Disclosure of Foreign Assets

A returning NRI must disclose:

Foreign bank accounts (including joint accounts)

Foreign immovable properties

Foreign financial interests (shares, bonds, insurance, etc.)

Foreign trusts and other fiduciary capacities

Any other overseas income earned during the financial year

Non-disclosure may lead to strict penalties under the Black Money Act, including fines and possible prosecution.

Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) for NRIs

The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) for NRIs plays a vital role in preventing dual taxation on income earned abroad. If a returning NRI has already paid taxes on foreign income in another country, they can claim relief under the DTAA while filing an income tax return India for NRI.

TDS Refund for NRIs

Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is applicable to NRIs on various types of income, including capital gains, rent, and interest. However, returning NRIs may qualify for a TDS refund for NRIs by filing the necessary tax documents in India.

New Income Tax Rules for NRIs

The new income tax rules for NRIs introduced stricter regulations to curb tax evasion. Some key changes include:

NRIs who spend more than 120 days in India in a financial year may be classified as residents.

Mandatory reporting of foreign income and assets for individuals qualifying as tax residents.

Yes, for NRIs classified as residents, their global income is taxable. For NRIs still classified as non-residents, only Indian-sourced income is taxed.

By adhering to tax regulations and making accurate disclosures under income tax in India for NRIs, individuals can avoid penalties and legal complications.
